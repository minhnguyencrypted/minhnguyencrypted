# Minh Nguyen repository
This is the official repository of Minh Nhat Nguyen - a UNIX-like OS powered person.

## About
The system consists of the Open Source UNIX-like kernel (licensed under GNU GPL v2.0) and 
some Proprietary (sorry, but it's my secret) modules for more critical and complex tasks such as
Relationships and Personality.

## Skills and Features
The UNIX-like kernel is monolithic and made up of complex and highly-structured libraries and processes management technologies.  
This brings the system more mental stability and advanced performance in programming, motorcycle and an UNIX sense of humour.

Minh's Open Compiler Collection (MOCC™) is the principal open-source package for compiling and interpreting both Human Language  
(Vietnamese and English) and Programming Language (C and Java). This is also used by the Kernel for implementing the so-called 
"Programming mindset".

## Passions
Passion Implementing and Managing System (PIMS™) is the system of libraries and managing processes which used to allocate his 
human power to dedicate for his passions, which also is apart of his skills and strengths

PIMS™ has been being implemented so successfully for Programming for over 7 years and stably on Motorcycle for more than 6 months, 
and many other skills/habbits.

## License
This system is Mixed Source: Kernel is licensed under GNU GPL v2.0, other packages are proprietary.
